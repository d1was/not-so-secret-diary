I didn't used to love running. Previously I've tried to run many times occasionally but couldn't continue for more than 2 or three days. Then i watched [Run with the wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_with_the_Wind), an anime where group of friends decides to run for a  competition. It was such an beautiful anime, i cant describe with words. Then i started to get a feel for running. I woke up next day and ran 7 km. It was very hard, but i enjoyed it. While running, i began to feel like i was leaving everything behind. I felt like i'm the only one alive in this world and i was experiencing every breath i took in and out. Then next day, it rained and i didn't run, and same for next few days. But today i thought that i have to plan a challenge so i can provide the consistency.So, I decided to run 10K for 30 days straight and write my experience about it. And here i am.

## My running playlist
I love to listen to something while running. I have a nokia phone with a memory slot. I borrowed one memory card from my brother. Then i got a idea that, why not download naruto's every original sound track and run with them. I'm gonna feel like i am the naruto and i'll be running to save sasuke. Yeah that'll be fun. :D

So.. I'm gonna sign out for today, it's 9pm now. Tomorrow, i'll have to wake up at 
3:30 and start this mini journey. Good Night.

## Day 1

I woke up at 3:45 in the morning. Straight up went to the bathroom, get freshed, then get dressed with my linkin park half sleeve vest and argentina world cup 2018 short. Then, i picked my nokia phone, it was 4:00 when i went downstairs. Then warmed up for 20 minutes with light exercise. It was 4:21 when i reached the main highway from where i  decided to start my run. Then with little steps forward, shifting one leg forward turnwise, i started my journey.  
After running for 1 KM, i felt my knees shaking and i was breathing faster. I remembered to put my back straight and not to rush while running. I slowly ease my breath and went with the flow. It was very dark, stars were twinkling. I was the only one in the road for most of the times. One after another i passed the kilometer pillar. I was very tired when i reached 5KM mark. I checked my mobile and it was 5:58. I tied my shoe lace and then returned the same path. Morning light was shining and people's number in the road began to rise as the time passes. I was very tired during 7KM mark, but deep down i was just running with the wind. I was just letting myself go, and was not making any effort to run. My body was just shifting forward automatically. At 9KM I was out of my breath.My running pace was very slow at this time. I was thinking in one part of the mind to give up. But then again i thought just one kilometer more. Just one breath more, just one step more. Then i kept going, i felt very refreshed when i saw that 10KM pillar from far aside. I then kept running defying my lungs. And at last, i did it. I ran 10KM. I felt very good and very happy. I then thought, yeah i'll do it tommorow again.
