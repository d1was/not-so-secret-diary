I didn't used to love running. Previously I've tried to run many times occasionally but couldn't continue for more than 2 or three days. Then i watched [Run with the wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_with_the_Wind), an anime where group of friends decides to run for a  competition. It was such an beautiful anime, i cant describe with words. Then i started to get a feel for running. I woke up next day and ran 7 km. It was very hard, but i enjoyed it. While running, i began to feel like i was leaving everything behind. I felt like i'm the only one alive in this world and i was experiencing every breath i took in and out. Then next day, it rained and i didn't run, and same for next few days. But today i thought that i have to plan a challenge so i can provide the consistency.So, I decided to run 10K for 30 days straight and write my experience about it. And here i am.

## My running playlist
I love to listen to something while running. I have a nokia phone with a memory slot. I borrowed one memory card from my brother. Then i got a idea that, why not download naruto's every original sound track and run with them. I'm gonna feel like i am the naruto and i'll be running to save sasuke. Yeah that'll be fun. :D

So.. I'm gonna sign out for today, it's 9pm now. Tomorrow, i'll have to wake up at 
3:30 and start this mini journey. Good Night.
