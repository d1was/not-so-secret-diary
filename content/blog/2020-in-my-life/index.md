So its a fullstop for 2020. I didnt even realize how fast this year went by. It was like yesterday, when covid outbreak happened in nepal and i was told to work from home. Then i flew straight to my village and started spending time with my family. Then like in an instant, People were wishing christmas and new year.

Thanks to 2020. It happened and completed its cycle. Although many people feel diffrent to you 2020, but i will love you nonetheless.

I happened to spend some precious time with my father,mother,brother and specially grandfather and grandmother. I landed a software development job that i can pay my bills with. I decided to grow my hair and i'm still growing it. It has been 9 month now. I love it. I started running and working out in a disciplined way. I'm still continuing it today. I played lots of football with my old friends. I read many books specially related to computer science and stuff, watched many anime including Haikyu, Attack on titan, Dr Stone, Bleach, etc and etc. I gained a good amount of weight, last time i checked i was 73 KG. I completly gave up on eating meat which i was trying from a very long time. I started to live life without feeling stress and anxiety. Trying to be an optimistic nihilistic person helped a lot. Life was very beautiful in 2020, every ray of light that fell upon my skin made me fall in love with this universe and this life. I was not my body nor my brain. I was much more than that. Arigato.
